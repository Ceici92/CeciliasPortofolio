Hello !

I am Cecilia, a creative and enthusiastic experience designer and engineer based in Paris.

Currently in my last year at the French engineering school Telecom SudParis, I am doing my final year internship at Dassault Systemes, 
where I am designing the functional aspects and the best user experience of a complete process of design in Virtual Reality.

Before I joined a school specialised in IT, I always had a sensibility for the graphical universe and been passionate about technological innovations.
Therefore working on the design of experiences based on new technologies is a way to combine those two thematics.

Apart from work, I like to draw, visit exhibitions, and dance.
