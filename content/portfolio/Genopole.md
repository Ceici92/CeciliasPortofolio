Evry's Genopole is a bioparc dedicated to biotechnologies, divided in 5 campuses, where research laboratories, companies and a hospital are spread.
To enable researchers or entrepreneurs to visualise the bioparc at distance, the employees of the Genopole wanted to enable a **visit of the campuses in Virtual Reality**. 
Alongside two colleagues, we decided to take part in this project during our 2nd year at the engineering school Telecom SudParis.

We created all the 3D models of the buildings and the exterior of the first 3 campuses in Blender, then we exported them in Unity, where we implemented the user navigation.
However, due to the lockdowns, we did not have access to a virtual reality headset and could not test the visit in VR. Therefore, we decided to create a desktop application.

You can find below a video representative of the virtual visit through the application :
