As a project during my second year at my engineering school, I teamed-up with two students and we collaborated with Evry's Genepole to create a virtual visit of their campus.

&nbsp;

- **Need of the Genopole:**

Evry's Genopole is a bioparc dedicated to biotechnologies, divided in 5 campuses, where research laboratories, companies and a hospital are spread.
**To enable researchers or entrepreneurs to visualise the bioparc at distance, the employees of the Genopole wanted to create a visit of the campuses in Virtual Reality**. 

- **Our work:**

**We created all the 3D models of the buildings and the exterior of the first 3 campuses in Blender, then we exported them in Unity, where we implemented the user navigation.**
However, due to the lockdowns, we did not have access to a virtual reality headset and could not test the visit in VR. Therefore, we decided to create a desktop application.

&nbsp;


You can find below a video representative of the virtual visit through the application, along with an oral description of the steps of our work :

Here is also images of the 3D models with more textures in Blender :
