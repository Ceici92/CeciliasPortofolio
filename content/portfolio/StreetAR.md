As a transversal project during my master 2 in Virtual and Augmented Reality, a colleague and I created an AR application dedicated to one fresco.    

- **Context of the fresco:**

As a previous project with my school, I teamed with 6 other students to put in place **a project to connect students of our school and children of several activity centers in Evry.**
Based on our interests, **we decided to animate activity groups around art and to paint a fresco in partnership with the street artist Vince and Evry's city hall.**
During the last activity group, we organised a brainstorming session, children had to come up with characters or stories around the environment that they wanted to see on the fresco.
Based on the brainstorming, the artist Vince created a design, and we spend 2 days all together painting  the fresco.

- **The AR Application Process:**

**We decided to make an AR application in connection with art, and this magnific fresco was the perfect support.**
With my colleague, we worked around three problematics: **how to transpose street art into the world of augmented reality, how to make this experience attractive, and how to address it to people who do not know AR?**

**To do so, we organised our time in five phases: Immersion, Ideation, Organisation, Production and Presentation**.
For each phase, I described what we have done below:

- **The Result:**

I learned a lot about storytelling in VR, the different technologies on Unity to make AR applications, the general workflow of the creation of a AR application with 3D characters, and I improved my skills on Blender and Unity.

Finally, I am proud of the application we created,, and I let you discover it on the video bellow :
