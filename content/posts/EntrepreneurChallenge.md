During my second year at the engineering school Telecom SudParis, I took part in the "Entrepreneur Challenge" organized by its startup incubator.

With a team of six, we had one week to imagine an innovative startup, and to produce a fifteen-page document with: the problem our start-up would answer, information about the market, 
a description of the competitors, a marketing and comercial plan, how we would put in place our somlution, the organisation of its launching, and financial viability arguments.

Below, I describe the pertinent steps of reflexion we had.


&nbsp;

### Our idea

As six students passionate about the world of art, and studying numerical technologies, we decided to imagine a solution mixing both.


Museums, in order to maintain their frequentation and their role as a source of knowledge, have to adapt themselves to the public, acquire more visibility and maintain their interest. 

Well, with the omnipresence of the digital, we assist to a real demand of visitors to integrate digital technologies in the cultural experience.
They need to access easily to information about several museums and testimonies.


Our solution consist of the creation of a communotary platform binding museums and visitors.

In the same platform, the users would have access to a map of the existing museums in specific zones, to news related to their interests, to a community of internautes sharing their recommandations, 
to a personal community of their closed ones, to a shazam of arts to know the essential about a piece of art in one picture and then to discover the information about the museum in which it is. 

Finally, once a museum is selected, if it is one of our partners, the user will be able to buy his tickets online and download an immersive visit package.
Those immersive routes will interact with the visitor through a digital equipment. 
For example, the visitor will be able to access information about a specific element he is interested in, information that could be unseen like a color reconstruction or the reconstruction of a context.

At the end, a visit recap will be sharable with the community.


&nbsp;

### The targets

Then, we define more precisely the targets of our solution. 
To do so, we were inspired by our own profiles, and we looked for individuals both intersted in art and technology.


&nbsp;

Our **BtoC offer** concerns men and women from 16 to 59 years old, that are interested in culture, art, and tourisme. 
They are familiar with the digital technologies. 
The use of our application could be common or occasional, thus, we elaborated **two personas**.


First, **Mathilde**, is a student of 20 years-old in an engeniring school.
She is passionate about art and culture since she is little. 
She even took part in the association dedicated to arts in her school.
She likes to talk and discuss about art and philosophy.
Curious, she is always looking into expand her knowledge.
She practices deiverse arts and share her results on the social medias.
She is familiar with the numerical tools.
Curious to try to new experiences, she is opened to expériment immersive visits in museums that she visits frequently.

Secondly, **Jean**, a young executive, is aged of 45 years-old. 
He is passionate about history and he visits several monuments and historical places during the year.
He always travels with his two children and his wife to visit historical sites, in order to share his passion with them.
Familar with numerical tools, he looks into the recommandaions onine before scheduling a visit. 
Searcjing for new experiences enabling him tolive his passop, and to share it with his children, the idea of immersive experiences intersts him particularily.

&nbsp;

As for our **BtoB offer**, it concerns cultural institutions.
Our clients are public or private museums, and the monuments with a strong historical value, that want to enrich and enhance their visitors experience.
Once again, we elaborated **two personas**.

First, a parisian museum considered as a public institution, having the appelation "Musée de France".
The museum has for mission to make its collection accessible to the widest public, and is looking for ways to enhance its visitors' experience, and this is why it called us.


Secondly, a private company ensuring: the management of historical monuments and museums, the creation of art centers, and the organisation of temporrary digital immersive exhibitions.
The company has a strong will to innovate, and enhance consistently the experience of the visitors.

&nbsp;

Thus, private or public, museum or historical monument, the mission is the same: to conceive and put in place educational and diffusion actions in order to ensure the equal access to all to culture.


&nbsp;

### The Competitors

We also made researchs about our BtoB competitors: french mixed-reality startups that offer immersive experiences in museums, and we identified Google Arts & Culture and Smartify as our major competitors as a platform.

We looked into their solutions and results in order to offer the most seductive services.


&nbsp;

### Set-up of our solution

The goal is to put in place a communautary platform that would enable every art-lover to access all the fonctionalities he could wish for. 
The platform would be available on smartphone and on the web**.

A colleague and I were focused on the creation of the following illustration.
To imagine how our platform will be organised and what it will look like, we started by doing some sketches.

Once we were satisfied with our ideas, we created wireframes of the mobile view with **Marvel**.
They illustrate the **user path** in our plaform: the creation of an account, the news' page with expositions to discover, the personalised welcoming page, the chat groups.

Besides, we also made views of the platform in desktop (still with Marvel), we illustrated the page of art recognition through a picture, the page with an interactive map, and the one with the selection of immersive packages.

Finally, I made with **Photshop** views of an interactive exhibition about Van Gogh. 

To do so, I first imagined two interesting scenarios to represent immersive visits, then I collected the images of the background online and edited them with Photoshop, then I made the mobile views with Marvel, and I integated them in the Photoshop document.
Furthemore, I tried to make a gif with Photoshop to represent how Van Gogh is in the virtual experience.

The following views represent: the list of the immersive paintings, the interactive map of the exhibition, the use of the Shazam tool, and Van Gogh as a personal tour Guide in augmented reality:
