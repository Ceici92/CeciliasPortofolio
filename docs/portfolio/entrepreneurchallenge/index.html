         <h1>Cultural Platform &amp; Interactive Visits</h1>
         <p>During my second year at the engineering school Telecom SudParis, I took part in the &ldquo;Entrepreneur Challenge&rdquo; organized by the start-up incubator.</p>
<p><strong>In a team of six, we had one week to imagine an innovative start-up</strong>, and to produce a fifteen-page document describing: the problem our start-up would answer, its market,
its competitors, the marketing and commercial plan, its implementation, the organisation of its launching, and financial elements.</p>
<p>Below, I describe some steps of the reflexion around the start-up.</p>
<h2 id="our-idea">Our idea</h2>
<p><strong>As six students passionate about the world of art, and studying numerical technologies, we decided to imagine a solution mixing both.</strong></p>
<h4 id="the-problem">The Problem:</h4>
<p>Museums, to maintain their frequentation and their role as a source of knowledge, have to adapt themselves to the public, acquire more visibility and maintain their interest.</p>
<p>Well, with the omnipresence of the digital, we assist to a real demand of visitors to integrate digital technologies in the cultural experience.
They need to access easily to information about several museums and testimonies.</p>
<h4 id="our-solution">Our solution:</h4>
<p><strong>Our solution consists of the creation of a community platform binding museums and visitors, with the exclusive acess to immersive visit packages.</strong></p>
<p>In the same platform, the users would have access to a map of the existing museums in specific zones, to news related to their interests, to a community of internauts sharing their recommendations,
to a personal community of their closed ones, to a shazam of arts to know the essential about a piece of art in one picture and then to discover the information about the museum in which it is.</p>
<p>Finally, once a museum is selected, if it is one of our partners, the user will be able to buy his tickets online and download an <strong>immersive visit package</strong>.
Those immersive routes will interact with the visitor through a digital equipment.
For example, the visitor will be able to access information about a specific element he is interested in, information that could be unseen like a color reconstruction or the reconstruction of a context.</p>
<p>At the end, a visit recap will be sharable with the community.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="the-targets">The targets</h2>
<p>Then, we define more precisely the targets of our solution.
To do so, we were inspired by our own profiles, and we looked for individuals both interested in art and technology.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our <strong>B2C offer</strong> concerns men and women from 16 to 59 years old, that are interested in culture, art, and tourism.
They are familiar with the digital technologies.
The use of our application could be common or occasional, thus, we elaborated <strong>two personas</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mathilde</strong>, is a student of 20 years old in an engineering school.
She is passionate about art and culture since she is little.
She likes to talk and discuss about art and philosophy.
Curious, she is always looking into expand her knowledge.
She practices diverse arts and share her results on the social medias.
She is familiar with the numerical tools.
Curious to try to new experiences, she is opened to experiment immersive visits in museums that she visits frequently.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jean</strong>, a young executive, is aged of 45 years old.
He is passionate about history and he visits several monuments and historical places during the year.
He always travels with his two children and his wife to visit historical sites, in order to share his passion with them.
Familiar with numerical tools, he looks into the recommendations online before scheduling a visit.
Searching for new experiences enabling him to live his passion, and to share it with his children, the idea of immersive experiences interests him particularly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>As for our <strong>B2B offer</strong>, it concerns cultural institutions.
Our clients are public or private museums, and the monuments with a strong historical value, that want to enrich and enhance their visitors' experience.
Once again, we elaborated <strong>two personas</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Parisian museum</strong> considered as a public institution, having the appellation &ldquo;Musee de France&rdquo;.
The museum has for mission to make its collection accessible to the widest public and is looking for ways to enhance its visitors' experience, and this is why it called us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A private company</strong> ensuring: the management of historical monuments and museums, the creation of art centers, and the organisation of temporarily digital immersive exhibitions.
The company has a strong will to innovate and enhance consistently the experience of the visitors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus, private or public, museum or historical monument, the mission is the same: to conceive and put in place educational and diffusion actions in order to ensure the equal access to all to culture.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="the-competitors">The Competitors</h2>
<p>We also made researches about our BtoB competitors: French mixed-reality start-ups that offer immersive experiences in museums, and we identified Google Arts &amp; Culture and Smartify as our major competitors as a platform.</p>
<p>We investigated their solutions and results in order to offer the most seductive services.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="set-up-of-our-solution">Set-up of our solution</h2>
<p><strong>The platform would be available on smartphone and on the web</strong>.</p>
<p>A colleague and I were focused on the creation of the following illustration.
To imagine how our platform will be organised and what it will look like, we started by doing some <strong>sketches</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ceici92.github.io/CeciliasPortofolio/img/EntrepreneurChallenge/Sketch.jpg" alt="Sketch"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once we were satisfied, <strong>we created wireframes of the mobile view with Marvel</strong>.
<strong>They illustrate the user journey in our platform</strong>: the creation of an account, the news' page with expositions to discover, the personalised welcoming page, the chat groups.</p>
<p><img src="https://ceici92.github.io/CeciliasPortofolio/img/EntrepreneurChallenge/Wireframes.png" alt="Wireframes"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Besides, <strong>we also made views of the platform in desktop</strong> (still with Marvel), we illustrated the page of art recognition through a picture, the page with an interactive map, and the one with the selection of immersive packages.
<strong>Finally, I made with Photoshop views of an interactive exhibition about Van Gogh.</strong></p>
<p>To do so, I first imagined two interesting scenarios to represent immersive visits, then I collected the images of the background online and edited them with Photoshop, then I made the mobile views with Marvel, and I integrated them in the Photoshop document.
Furthermore, I tried to make a gif with Photoshop to represent how Van Gogh is in the virtual experience.</p>
<p>The following views represent: the list of the immersive paintings, the interactive map of the exhibition, the use of the Shazam tool, and Van Gogh as a personal tour guide in augmented reality:</p>
