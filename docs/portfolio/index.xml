      <description>test As a transversal project during my master 2 in Virtual and Augmented Reality, a colleague and I created an AR application dedicated to one fresco.
 Context of the fresco:  As a previous project with my school, I teamed with 6 other students to put in place a project to connect students of our school and children of several activity centers in Evry. Based on our interests, we decided to animate activity groups around art and to paint a fresco in partnership with the street artist Vince and Evry&amp;rsquo;s city hall.</description>

      <description>As a project during my second year at my engineering school, I teamed-up with two students and we collaborated with Evry&amp;rsquo;s Genepole to create a virtual visit of their campus.
Â  Need of the Genopole:  Evry&amp;rsquo;s Genopole is a bioparc dedicated to biotechnologies, divided in 5 campuses, where research laboratories, companies and a hospital are spread. To enable researchers or entrepreneurs to visualise the bioparc at distance, the employees of the Genopole wanted to create a visit of the campuses in Virtual Reality.</description>

      <description>During my second year at the engineering school Telecom SudParis, I took part in the &amp;ldquo;Entrepreneur Challenge&amp;rdquo; organized by the start-up incubator.
In a team of six, we had one week to imagine an innovative start-up, and to produce a fifteen-page document describing: the problem our start-up would answer, its market, its competitors, the marketing and commercial plan, its implementation, the organisation of its launching, and financial elements.
Below, I describe some steps of the reflexion around the start-up.</description>
